      <h3><strong>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio people!!!</strong></h3>
      <p>
        I'm <strong>KARUNYA DARSI</strong>, a third-year Computer Science and Engineering student at SRM University AP. I am passionate about technology,
        particularly in areas like web development and AI & ML. My goal is to become a software engineer and contribute to tech innovations. This portfolio is a reflection of my academic journey,
        showcasing the projects and work Iâ€™ve undertaken, as well as my passion for technology and problem-solving. As I continue to expand my knowledge and expertise in computer science,
        my ultimate goal is to pursue higher education abroad to gain a global perspective on the tech industry. I believe that immersing myself in diverse cultures and learning from experts worldwide
        will equip me with the skills and insights needed to make a meaningful impact in the field.
